<p class="title">ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nico. I make tech for a more caring, just, playful world.</p>

<p>Currently, my focus is on product and reliability engineering for healthcare. My work supports doctors and nurses caring for patients both remotely and in person; I've also built systems for pharmacists and patients to manage
    home delivery of life-saving medications.</p>

<p>I am a cofounder of <a href="https://www.netdocuments.com/press-releases/netdocuments-inspires-productivity-with-acquisition-of-afterpattern-document-automation" target="_blank">an exited social impact startup,</a>
    formed around the mission of making legal assistance more accessible. Read an interview with an expert attorney using our software to advise on immigration cases <a href="https://afterpattern.com/siskind-susser" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>In the past I led an interactive product team at BuzzFeed and designed games for NBC Universal and Adult Swim.
    Much more impressively, I made a game for a <a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/step-inside-the-dreamhouse-where-diy-arcade-games-meet-queer-culture#photo-1" target="_blank">custom arcade cabinet</a> in Brooklyn.
    You can play it at <a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/" target="_blank">Wonderville</a> or online on <a href="https://itch.io/b/239/the-dreamboxxx-bundle-custom-made-lgbtq-arcade-games" target="_blank">itch.io</a>,
    where bundle proceeds were donated to <a href="https://maketheroadny.org/" target="blank">Make the Road.</a></p>

<p>I'm always excited to hear about projects whose business model is aligned with dramatically improving the lives of everyday people.
