<p class="title">oh, hello!</p>
<p>my name is Nicole. I build tech for a more playful, more just, and more expressive world.</p>
<p>I'm a technical cofounder of a startup aiming to <a href="https://community.lawyer/about" target="_blank">
increase access to affordable legal help.</a> </p>
<p>in the past I've led an interactive product team at BuzzFeed
and designed games for NBC Universal, FreshPlanet, and Adult Swim.</p>
<p>I spend my free time biking around Brooklyn, scouting used book stores,
  and daydreaming about collaborations to do with friends.</p>
