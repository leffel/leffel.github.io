### Royal Rows
Our goal with this project was to create a match-3 game engine that could be readily branded for different television channels. Originally created for tv series Royal Pains, Royal Rows features over 60 unique levels, exciting combos and powerups, and a big map to explore!

* Launched in 2013 for web. [Play it here.](http://bit.ly/18QyTcv)
* Developed partnership between Fidel and NBC Universal Game Network.
* Robust feature set that match-3 lovers expect from their favorite games.
* Visually engaging yet information-dense UI design.
* This white label engine was also re-branded for Real Housewives as "Cocktail Crush."
