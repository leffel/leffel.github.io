### Caption Contest Format
Content creators use this format to craft captionable scenes for readers. Readers contribute their funny captions, after which they can share them across social media platforms - or directly into the comments.

* Launched in 2015 for mobile web and the BuzzFeed app. [Try it here!](http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/madonna-has-her-drake-and-eats-it)
* A supplementary creation tool empowers editorial staff to make and publish their own caption contests on the fly. 
* Localized for international audiences.
* Integrated with the BuzzFeed comment system.
