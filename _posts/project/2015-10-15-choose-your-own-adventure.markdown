####Choose Your Own Adventure Format
By integrating [Twine](https://twinery.org/) with our own games code base, we empowered writers to make and publish their own Choose Your Own Adventure games on BuzzFeed. Players tap their way through a branching narrative and share their endings.


* Launched in 2015 for mobile web and the BuzzFeed app. [Try it here!](http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisoncaporimo/get-dat-tat)
* A supplementary creation tool empowers editorial staff to make and publish their own CYOA games on the fly. 
* Over a dozen posts using this format were created in 2015. [You can browse many of them here.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/choose_your_own_adventure)
* In addition to the standard page-turning layout, we also experimented with a layout that builds dynamically as the reader progresses. [Try it here!](http://www.buzzfeed.com/nataliebrown/what-dessert-should-you-bake-this-weekend)
