Content creators use this format to craft mini puzzles for readers. Players type in an answer to a question posed in the headline or as part of the image itself. They can guess as many times as they'd like, or give up if they're stumped!

* Launched in 2015 for mobile web and the BuzzFeed app. [Try it here!](http://www.buzzfeed.com/games/can-you-guess-these-movies-based-on-their-emoji)
* A supplementary creation tool empowers editorial staff to make and publish their own brainteaser puzzles on the fly. 
* Dozens of posts featured this format in 2015.
