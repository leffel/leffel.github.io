### Customer Service Chatbot
The player types messages to the chatbot in an attempt to cancel their cable service. The chatbot is pretty absurdist!

* Launched in 2014 for mobile web and the BuzzFeed app. [Try it here!](http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/can-you-get-comcast-to-cancel-your-service)
* We leveraged a previous chatbot format to quickly respond to a [call with a Comcast rep](http://www.buzzfeed.com/juliafurlan/service-service-service-service) that went viral the day before.
