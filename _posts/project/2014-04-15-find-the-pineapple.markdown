####Find The Famous Pineapple
Find the Famous Pineapple is a hidden object game developed for the Psych television audience. Pineapples are “hidden” in both classic paints and stylized renders show episodes, and players must find as many pineapples as possible within the time limit.

* Developed in partnership with This Is Pop and the NBC Universal Games Network.
* HTML5 implementation for cross-device capabilities.
